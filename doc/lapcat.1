.SH NAME
lapcat \- Location Aware Proxy Chooser And Tunneler


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lapcat
.RI [ options ]
<host> <port>


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlapcat\fP is a netcat-like tool which opens up a TCP/IP connection to
a particular host, on a particular port.

How the connection is established depends on a set of rules which may vary
depending on host, active network connection and availability.


.SH OPTIONS
.P
  -v       Enable debug output.
.P
  -v -v    Enable even more debug output.


.SH MODES

Lapcat operates in one of 4 different modes: netcat mode, HTTP Proxy mode,
dedicated mode and one-off mode.  Each are described below.

In netcat mode, lapcat will connect to the remote host and relay data back
and forth to the standard input and output.  This is similar to using the
telnet or netcat tools.
